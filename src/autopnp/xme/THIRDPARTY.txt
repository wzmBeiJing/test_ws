License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS
PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR
OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS
LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED
TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN
CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

 a) "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other
    pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work,
    arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work,
    or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or
    any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted
    including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that
    a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation
    for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the
    Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of
    the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be
    considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
 b) "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
    encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts,
    or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f)
    below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their
    contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is
    included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other
    contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in
    themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole.
    A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation
    (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.
 c) "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is listed at
    http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been approved by
    Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this License,
    including, at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains terms that
    have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License Elements of
    this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing of
    adaptations of works made available under that license under this License
    or a Creative Commons jurisdiction license with the same License Elements
    as this License.
 d) "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and
    copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other
    transfer of ownership.
 e) "License Elements" means the following high-level license attributes as
    selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License:
    Attribution, ShareAlike.
 f) "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that
    offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
 g) "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the
    individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no
    individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition
    (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers,
    and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or
    otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore;
    (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal
    entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and,
    (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the
    broadcast.
 h) "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms
    of this License including without limitation any production in the
    literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or
    form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet
    and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same
    nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or
    entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without
    words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed
    by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting,
    architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work
    to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to
    photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch
    or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography,
    architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a
    compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable
    work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the
    extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.
 i) "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
    License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with
    respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the
    Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous
    violation.
 j) "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and
    to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or
    process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital
    performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that
    members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a
    place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public
    by any means or process and the communication to the public of the
    performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to
    broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs,
    sounds or images.
 k) "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including
    without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of
    fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of
    a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other
    electronic medium.

2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,
   limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising
   from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection
   with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable
   laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
   Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
   perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
   exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

 a) to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
    Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
    Collections;
 b) to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
    including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to
    clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made
    to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The
    original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a
    modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
 c) to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated
    in Collections; and,
 d) to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

 e) For the avoidance of doubt:
      i)   Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions
           in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
           compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor
           reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any
           exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
      ii)  Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
           which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
           compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives
           the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise
           by You of the rights granted under this License; and,
      iii) Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to
           collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that
           the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers
           voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise
           by You of the rights granted under this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known
or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such
modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other
media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted
by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
   subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

 a) You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of
    this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
    Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
    Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on
    the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the
    recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
    under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must
    keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer
    of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly
    Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not
    impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the
    ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted
    to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies
    to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the
    Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of
    this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor
    You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit
    as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation,
    upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove
    from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
 b) You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms
    of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same
    License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction
    license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same
    License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US));
    (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation
    under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms
    of that license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of
    the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"),
    you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the
    following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the
    Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or
    Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the
    Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability
    of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that
    recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep
    intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the
    disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the
    Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or
    Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective
    technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a
    recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that
    recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b)
    applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
    not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made
    subject to the terms of the Applicable License.
 c) If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
    Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section
    4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide,
    reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the
    Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the
    Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g.,
    a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution
    ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service
    or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the
    title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable,
    the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,
    unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
    information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the
    case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the
    Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or
    "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit
    required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
    provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a
    minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors
    of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and
    in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing
    authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required
    by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above
    and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly
    or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or
    endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties,
    as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate,
    express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or
    Attribution Parties.
 d) Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
    otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
    Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations
    or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other
    derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to
    the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
    jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in
    Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be
    deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory
    action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the
    Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the
    fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to
    reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right
    to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

 a) This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
    upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or
    entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this
    License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such
    individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.
    Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
 b) Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
    Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
    Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at
    any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
    withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required
    to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will
    continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

 a) Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the
    Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms
    and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
 b) Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers
    to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and
    conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
 c) If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
    remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
    parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
    extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
 d) No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
    consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed
    by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
 e) This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
    respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements
    or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor
    shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any
    communication from You. This License may not be modified without the
    mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
 f) The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
    License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention
    for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September
    28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996,
    the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal
    Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and
    subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the
    License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding
    provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the
    applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under
    applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under
    this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the
    License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any
    rights under applicable law.

CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES.

CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS

FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE. 

License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS
PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR
OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS
LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED
TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN
CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

 a) "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other
    pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work,
    arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work,
    or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or
    any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted
    including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that
    a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation
    for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the
    Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of
    the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be
    considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
 b) "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
    encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts,
    or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f)
    below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their
    contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is
    included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other
    contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in
    themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole.
    A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation
    (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.
 c) "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is listed at
    http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been approved by
    Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this License,
    including, at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains terms that
    have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License Elements of
    this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing of
    adaptations of works made available under that license under this License
    or a Creative Commons jurisdiction license with the same License Elements
    as this License.
 d) "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and
    copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other
    transfer of ownership.
 e) "License Elements" means the following high-level license attributes as
    selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License:
    Attribution, ShareAlike.
 f) "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that
    offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
 g) "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the
    individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no
    individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition
    (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers,
    and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or
    otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore;
    (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal
    entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and,
    (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the
    broadcast.
 h) "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms
    of this License including without limitation any production in the
    literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or
    form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet
    and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same
    nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or
    entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without
    words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed
    by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting,
    architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work
    to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to
    photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch
    or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography,
    architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a
    compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable
    work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the
    extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.
 i) "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
    License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with
    respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the
    Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous
    violation.
 j) "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and
    to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or
    process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital
    performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that
    members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a
    place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public
    by any means or process and the communication to the public of the
    performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to
    broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs,
    sounds or images.
 k) "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including
    without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of
    fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of
    a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other
    electronic medium.

2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,
   limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising
   from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection
   with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable
   laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
   Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
   perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
   exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

 a) to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
    Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
    Collections;
 b) to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
    including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to
    clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made
    to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The
    original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a
    modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
 c) to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated
    in Collections; and,
 d) to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

 e) For the avoidance of doubt:
      i)   Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions
           in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
           compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor
           reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any
           exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
      ii)  Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
           which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
           compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives
           the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise
           by You of the rights granted under this License; and,
      iii) Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to
           collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that
           the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers
           voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise
           by You of the rights granted under this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known
or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such
modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other
media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted
by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
   subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

 a) You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of
    this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
    Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
    Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on
    the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the
    recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
    under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must
    keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer
    of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly
    Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not
    impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the
    ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted
    to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies
    to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the
    Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of
    this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor
    You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit
    as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation,
    upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove
    from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
 b) You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms
    of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same
    License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction
    license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same
    License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US));
    (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation
    under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms
    of that license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of
    the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"),
    you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the
    following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the
    Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or
    Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the
    Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability
    of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that
    recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep
    intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the
    disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the
    Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or
    Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective
    technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a
    recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that
    recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b)
    applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
    not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made
    subject to the terms of the Applicable License.
 c) If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
    Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section
    4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide,
    reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the
    Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the
    Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g.,
    a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution
    ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service
    or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the
    title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable,
    the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,
    unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
    information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the
    case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the
    Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or
    "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit
    required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
    provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a
    minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors
    of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and
    in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing
    authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required
    by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above
    and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly
    or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or
    endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties,
    as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate,
    express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or
    Attribution Parties.
 d) Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
    otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
    Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations
    or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other
    derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to
    the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
    jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in
    Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be
    deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory
    action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the
    Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the
    fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to
    reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right
    to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

 a) This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
    upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or
    entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this
    License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such
    individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.
    Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
 b) Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
    Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
    Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at
    any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
    withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required
    to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will
    continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

 a) Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the
    Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms
    and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
 b) Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers
    to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and
    conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
 c) If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
    remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
    parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
    extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
 d) No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
    consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed
    by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
 e) This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
    respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements
    or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor
    shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any
    communication from You. This License may not be modified without the
    mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
 f) The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
    License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention
    for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September
    28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996,
    the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal
    Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and
    subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the
    License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding
    provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the
    applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under
    applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under
    this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the
    License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any
    rights under applicable law.
