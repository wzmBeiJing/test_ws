CHROMOSOME Changelog
====================

Version 0.8 RC1 (2014-03-14)
----------------------------
Breaking Changes:
- CHG: XMT: The protected region for global variables in generated function
       stubs and component stubs has been renamed. These regions previously
       had an ID with a suffix "_STATIC_VARIABLES", which now has been renamed
       to just "_VARIABLES". Users need to manually copy any code in these
       regions to the newly generated ones. (Issue #3927)
- CHG: XMT: Removed protected region from component wrapper header files
       (Issue #3970)
- CHG: XMT: The generated CMakeXmeComponents.txt file which contained the build
       system component definitions for a node has been removed.
       A CMakeLists.txt file is generated _per_ component instead, directly
       in the "src" folder of the respective component. The protected regions
       in these files have also been renamed. Users therefore need to manually
       copy any content to the new regions. (Issues #3860)
- CHG: XMT: Restrict the search for protected regions to the file which are
       going to be generated (Issue #3852)
- CHG: "testsuite" example CMakeLists.txt now located directly in
       examples/testsuite (Issue #3984)
- CHG: Function xme_core_pnp_pnpManager_instantiateComponentOnNode() has been
       deprecated. Use xme_core_pnp_pnpManager_plugInNewComponent() instead.
       (Issues #3974)
- CHG: Function xme_core_pnp_pnpClient_instantiateComponentOnThisNode() has
       been deprecated. Use xme_core_pnp_pnpClient_plugInNewComponent()
       instead. (Issues #3974)
- CHG: Data Handler has been completely redesigned. Subtle changes in behavior
       might be present. (Issue #3817)

Other Changes:
- NEW: A new core component called Component Repository has been added
       (located in xme/core/nodeManager/...). This component can be used to
       retrieve information about all component instances on the current node.
       On the node with the Plug And Play Manager it will have information
       about all component instances in the system. (Issues #3974, #3881)
- NEW: It is now possible to specify port queue sizes and function execution
       periods for new component instances at runtime and in XMT. At runtime
       this can be done by using a component builder
       (xme/core/nodeManager/include/componentRepositoryBuilder.h) and the
       new *_plugInNewComponent() function (see above). (Issues #3960, #3943)
- NEW: Main CMakeLists.txt for building all nodes of an example now located
       directly in examples/<example> (Issue #3984)
- NEW: Asynchronous Data Handler port access when XME_MULTITHREAD is defined
       (Issue #4001, #4061)
- NEW: XME/XMT: Support for automatically obtaining IP address from operating
       system (Issue #3651)
- NEW: Print determined IP address to console (Issue #4269)
- NEW: Emit warning when data is lost due to overwrites (Issue #4014)
- NEW: XMT: Also search for protected regions in *.cmake (Issue #3947)
- NEW: Build system: Include CMake files specifying components into the
       "Build System" folder of the respective component in Visual Studio
       (Issue #4032)
