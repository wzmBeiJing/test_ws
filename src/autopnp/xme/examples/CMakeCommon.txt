# File:
#         Common CMake definitions for example projects.
#         Include this file from within your project to apply
#         recommended settings to your build system.
#         This is done by putting the following block below your
#         project() definition (adapting the number of ".." to
#         the number of subdirectory levels of your project):
#
#         # Main project settings
#         set_property (GLOBAL PROPERTY XME_TARGET_IDENTIFIER "<target-platform>")
#         include ("../CMakeCommon.txt")
#
#         For a list of supported <target-platform>s, see the directory listing of
#         xme/ports/targets
#

# Note: Do *not* use this directory as CMake source directory! Rather use one
#       of the directories from within the examples directory. CHROMOSOME is
#       designed such that the firmware for each node is to be built using a
#       separate build system. Consult the documentation for details.
