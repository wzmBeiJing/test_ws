# Specify application-specific CHROMOSOME build options here. All available
# build options can be listed by enabling the XME_ENABLE_BUILD_OPTION_DUMP
# CMake cache variable, i.e.:
#  - Command line: cmake -G "..." -DXME_ENABLE_BUILD_OPTION_DUMP=1
#  - CMake GUI:    Add Entry -> XME_ENABLE_BUILD_OPTION_DUMP, BOOL, ON
# Re-run CMake afterwards to have the list of build options printed.
#
# In the following, use the xme_build_option_set() command to overwrite the
# value of a build option, e.g.:
#    xme_build_option_set(THE_BUILD_OPTION <new-value> "Reason")
