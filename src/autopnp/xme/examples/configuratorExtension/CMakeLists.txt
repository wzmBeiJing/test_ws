# This is the top-level CMakeLists.txt for the configuratorExtension project.
# Use it for building all nodes of the project in a single build system.
# This is meaningful if all nodes are to be compiled using the same toolchain
# for the same platform. If the nodes use individual toolchains, use the
# node-specific CMakeLists.txt files located in src/application/<node> instead.
# In this case, a separate build system has to be used for every node.
