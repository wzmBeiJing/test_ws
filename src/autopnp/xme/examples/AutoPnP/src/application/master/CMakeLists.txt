# This is the node-specific CMakeLists.txt for the master node of the
# AutoPnP project. Use it for building the node in a build
# system of its own. This is meaningful if the node uses a different compiler
# toolchain than other nodes of the same project. If all nodes are compiled
# using the same toolchain for the same platform, you may use the top-level
# CMakeLists.txt file located in ../../../ instead to generate a single
# build system for all nodes.
