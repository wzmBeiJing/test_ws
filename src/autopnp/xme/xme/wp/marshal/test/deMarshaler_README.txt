 Information about marshaler and demarshaler waypoint tests
--------------------------------------------------------------

Note that the marshaler and demarshaler waypoints need to be tailored towards a specific
topic dictionary. Therefore they will be generated. 
The marshaler and demarshaler components inside 'xme/wp' are specific instances
for a test topic dictionary (deMarshaler.xmd is the XMT model file for this dictionary) in 
order to test the generated marshaler.
The generation process itself must currently be done manually.
The marshaler and demarshaler in 'xme/wp' are not meant to be included in any XME 
application except for the testsuite.
