\section{Installing CMake on Windows}
\label{appx:install_cmake}

Follow these steps to install CMake on Windows
(on Linux, your distribution should include a package named \verb|cmake|; for more information see Section~\ref{sec:prereq:linux}).

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Point your favorite browser to \url{http://cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html}
		and click on the link corresponding to the Windows installer
		(compare Figure~\ref{fig:setup_cmake_download}).

\end{figure}

	\item After downloading the setup, launch it. Follow the instructions on the screen.
		When you get prompted whether to add CMake to the system PATH, you may choose to \emph{not} add it.
		\xme does not require CMake to be on the system search path.

\end{enumerate}
